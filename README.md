# Blob Game

## Inspiration:

- [YT Link](https://youtu.be/8Are9dDbW24)
- [Universe by Kurzgesagt](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/universe-in-a-nutshell/id1526364758)
- cookie clicker
- a dark room
- universal paperclip

## Levels:

1. Intro (main menu?)
2. Microscope (atomic)
3. Petri (bacterial)
4. Lab (scream sound effects)
5. City (attacks begin)
6. Earth
7. Sun solar system

## Plans for Tuesday (Jul 8):

_Playable game start to finish_

- game engine
  - biomass/size
  - level scaling
  - cost scaling
  - shop scaling?
- blob animations
  - tween the growth
  - tone the ripple down as it grows
- map
  - transitions between levels
  - simple first steps for today
- HUD:
  - add visual elements for generators (ask ai to brainstorm dif names)

## Plans for Wednesday (Jul 9):

- blob:
  - interaction with food
- map:
  - better quality/zoom feature
- game scaling:
  - headlines/achievements

## Animation details

**Scene change** --> once you reach a certain size, you 'evolve' and map zooms out
when blob is in a petri dish -- it fills up the petri dish and breaks out in a planned animation (breaks out and starts next phase)

### Stretch goals

**Juice (at end)**
- blob - nutrient interactions
- temporary power-ups show up on screen (double growth, cheaper shop, etc.) - this essentially replaces the idea of different types of slimes
- animations for level changes (breakout of petri dish, etc.)
- fun text updates/quotes on level upgrades
- enemies and associated upgrades (militaries or people eating?)
- control zoom level

## Out of scope

- accounts/session management
- splitting blobs
- 3D
- pausing
- moving anything besides the blob/map
