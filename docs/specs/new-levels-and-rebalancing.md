# New Levels and Rebalancing Specification

## Overview

This spec outlines the addition of two new levels (Neighborhood and Continent), corresponding upgrades and generators, and fixes to the upgrade system to ensure upgrades work as intended. The goal is to create smoother progression and make upgrades meaningful.

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Upgrade System Problems

- Upgrades are not properly targeting specific generators
- Upgrade effects are applied globally instead of to specific generator tiers
- No clear targeting system for which generators are affected by which upgrades

### 2. Tutorial System Problems

- `basic-generator` and `click-power-upgrade` are dummy components that don't follow normal game rules
- These components appear in GeneratorVisualization and value calculations when they shouldn't
- Special logic needed to exclude them from various systems
- Better to remove them entirely and create a proper tutorial sequence

### 3. Level Progression Gaps

- Large jumps between Lab (2.25M) ‚Üí City (800M) ‚Üí Earth (300B)
- Missing intermediate progression points
- Need for smoother scaling

### 4. Generator Balance Issues

- Some generators are too weak compared to others
- Cost scaling doesn't feel balanced
- Growth rates need adjustment

### 5. Click Power Scaling Issues

- No way to upgrade click power after the initial tutorial upgrade
- Click power becomes irrelevant as generators dominate
- Need a system to keep clicking meaningful throughout the game

## Tutorial System Replacement

### Current Tutorial Components (To Remove):

- `basic-generator`: Generates 0 biomass, costs 1 biomass
- `click-power-upgrade`: 2x click power, costs 0 biomass

### Problems with Current System:

1. **Special Logic Required**: These components need exclusion from:
   - GeneratorVisualization (they shouldn't show as emojis)
   - Value calculations (they shouldn't affect red/green/yellow dots)
   - Normal game progression (they're just tutorial placeholders)
2. **Confusing for Players**: Players see "0 biomass per second" generators
3. **Code Complexity**: Special cases throughout the codebase
4. **Not Scalable**: Adding more tutorial elements requires more special logic

### Solution:

Remove the dummy components entirely. This eliminates the need for special logic throughout the codebase and creates a cleaner, more maintainable system.

#### Benefits:

1. **No Special Logic**: All generators and upgrades follow normal rules
2. **Clean Code**: No exceptions or special cases needed
3. **Simpler Architecture**: No dummy components to maintain
4. **Better Player Experience**: Players start with real game mechanics

## New Level Structure

### Current Levels:

```
0. Intro (0 biomass)
1. Microscopic (1 biomass)
2. Petri Dish (2,500 biomass)

  type: 'growth',
  unlockedAtLevel: 'continent',

}
```

## Click Power Scaling System

### Current Problem:

- Click power starts at 1 and never increases
- Clicking becomes irrelevant as generators dominate
- No strategic value to clicking in mid/late game

### Proposed Solution:

Click power scales with current growth rate and can be upgraded through evolution and specific upgrades.

#### Click Power Formula:

```typescript
function calculateClickPower(gameState: GameState): number {
  const baseClickPower = 1;
  const growthMultiplier = 0.1; // Click power = 10% of current growth rate
  const evolutionBonus = gameState.highestLevelReached * 0.5; // +0.5 per level reached

  return baseClickPower + gameState.growth * growthMultiplier + evolutionBonus;
}
```

#### Evolution Click Power Bonus:

When evolving to a new level, click power gets a permanent bonus:

- Microscopic: +0.5 click power
- Petri Dish: +1.0 click power
- Lab: +1.5 click power
- Neighborhood: +2.0 click power
- City: +2.5 click power
- Continent: +3.0 click power
- Earth: +3.5 click power
- Solar System: +4.0 click power

#### Click Power Upgrades:

Add click power upgrades to various levels:

```typescript
// Microscopic Level
'click-mastery': {
  id: 'click-mastery',
  name: 'ü¶† Click Mastery',
  cost: 500,
  description: 'Click power = 15% of growth rate (instead of 10%)',
  effect: 1.5, // Multiplier for growth percentage
  type: 'click',
  unlockedAtLevel: 'microscopic'
},

// Lab Level
'precision-clicking': {
  id: 'precision-clicking',
  name: 'üß™ Precision Clicking',
  cost: 50000000,
  description: 'Click power = 20% of growth rate',
  effect: 2.0,
  type: 'click',
  unlockedAtLevel: 'lab'
},
'geographic-expansion': {
  id: 'geographic-expansion',
  name: 'üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Expansion',
  cost: 52000000000000,
  description: '5x All Continent Generators',
  effect: 5,
  type: 'growth',
  unlockedAtLevel: 'continent',
  targetLevel: 'continent' // NEW: Target specific level
},
'rapid-clicking': {
  id: 'rapid-clicking',
  name: 'üèôÔ∏è Rapid Clicking',
  cost: 5000000000,
  description: 'Click power = 25% of growth rate',
  effect: 2.5,
  type: 'click',
  unlockedAtLevel: 'city'
}
```

## Upgrade System Fix

### Current Problem:

The upgrade system applies effects globally to all generators, but the descriptions suggest they should target specific generator tiers.

### Solution:

Add a `targetLevel` field to upgrades and modify the growth calculation to only apply upgrades to generators from the specified level.

### Updated Upgrade Interface:

```typescript
export interface UpgradeState {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  cost: number;
  description: string;
  effect: number;
  type: "growth" | "split" | "click" | "blob";
  purchased: boolean;
  unlockedAtLevel: string;
  targetLevel?: string; // NEW: Which level's generators this affects
}
```

### Updated Growth Calculation:

```typescript
export function getTotalGrowth(state: GameState): number {
  let totalGrowth = 0;

  // Group generators by level
  const generatorsByLevel: Record<string, GeneratorState[]> = {};
  Object.values(state.generators).forEach((gen) => {
    if (!generatorsByLevel[gen.unlockedAtLevel]) {
      generatorsByLevel[gen.unlockedAtLevel] = [];
    }
    generatorsByLevel[gen.unlockedAtLevel].push(gen);
  });

  // Calculate base growth for each level
  const baseGrowthByLevel: Record<string, number> = {};
  Object.entries(generatorsByLevel).forEach(([level, generators]) => {
    baseGrowthByLevel[level] = generators.reduce((sum, gen) => {
      return sum + gen.baseEffect * gen.level;
    }, 0);
  });

  // Apply upgrades to specific levels
  let finalGrowth = 0;
  Object.entries(baseGrowthByLevel).forEach(([level, baseGrowth]) => {
    let levelGrowth = baseGrowth;

    // Apply upgrades that target this level
    Object.values(state.upgrades).forEach((upgrade) => {
      if (
        upgrade.purchased &&
        upgrade.type === "growth" &&
        upgrade.targetLevel === level
      ) {
        levelGrowth *= upgrade.effect;
      }
    });

    finalGrowth += levelGrowth;
  });

  return finalGrowth;
}
```

## Level UI Components

### New Level Components to Create:

1. `src/components/Map/levels/NeighborhoodLevel.tsx`
2. `src/components/Map/levels/ContinentLevel.tsx`

### Level Component Structure:

```typescript
// NeighborhoodLevel.tsx
export const NeighborhoodLevel: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="neighborhood-level">
      <div className="background">
        {/* Neighborhood background with houses, gardens, streets */}
      </div>
      <div className="foreground">
        {/* Neighborhood-specific visual elements */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

// ContinentLevel.tsx
export const ContinentLevel: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="continent-level">
      <div className="background">
        {/* Continent background with highways, railways, airports */}
      </div>
      <div className="foreground">
        {/* Continent-specific visual elements */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
