# Advanced Progression Spec

This document contains advanced, experimental, or shelved ideas for future progression and scaling features in the game.

## Advanced Upgrade Types

- **Cost Reducers:** Upgrades that reduce the cost scaling of specific generators (e.g., "Petri Dish upgrades cost 10% less").
- **Power-Up Enhancers:** Upgrades that increase the effect or duration of power-ups (e.g., "Golden Slimes last 5s longer").
- **Additive Upgrades:** Upgrades that add a flat amount to generator output (e.g., "+0.5 biomass/sec to all Petri generators").
- **Synergy Upgrades:** Upgrades that boost the output of one generator based on the number of another (e.g., "Each Nucleus Replicator increases Cell Divider output by 2%").
- **Prestige/Reset Upgrades:** For future versions, upgrades that persist across resets or provide meta-progression.

## Power-Up Mechanics

- **Power-Up Types:**
  - Temporary growth multipliers (e.g., 2x for 20s)
  - Instant biomass boosts (e.g., +50% current biomass)
  - Shop discount periods (e.g., 20s of 50% off)
  - Click power boosts (e.g., 10x click power for 10s)
  - Generator speed boosts (e.g., all generators produce 2x for 15s)
- **Power-Up Frequency:**
  - Can be affected by upgrades (e.g., "Power-ups appear 10% more often")
  - Can be made to appear more often as the player progresses
- **Power-Up Rarity:**
  - Some power-ups could be rare and more powerful

## Generator/Upgrade Unlock Variations

- Vary the number of generators/upgrades per level for more variety
- Unlock "bonus" generators or upgrades for special achievements

## Click Power Scaling

- Evolution-based click power boosts (e.g., every evolution increases click power by +1)
- Upgrades that multiply click power based on number of generators owned

## Other Experimental Features

- **Automation Upgrades:** Auto-buy generators/upgrades for a period
- **Temporary Challenges:** Timed events that offer big rewards for fast play
- **Prestige/Meta-Progression:** Reset for permanent bonuses
- **Dynamic Scaling:** Adjust scaling based on player performance (adaptive difficulty)

These features are not part of the MVP but are candidates for future updates or expansions.
